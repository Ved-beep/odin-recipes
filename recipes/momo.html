          <dd>
            Traditionally, momo is made with ground chicken, buffalo, or pork.

          <dd>

            Fresh ginger is an essential ingredient for adding flavor to the

        <h3>How to Prepare Momo Dough</h3>
        <p>
          The dough for momo is simple and soft. Itâ€™s made with all-purpose
          flour, water, and a pinch of salt. You need to knead the dough until
          it is smooth and elastic. Let it rest for about 30 minutes before you
          start making the wrappers.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>How to Make the Momo Filling</h3>
        <p>
          To prepare the filling, combine your choice of meat or vegetables with
          finely chopped onions, garlic, ginger, and the necessary spices. Add
          soy sauce for a savory flavor. Mix everything well until the
          ingredients are well incorporated.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>How to Stuff and Shape the Momo</h3>
        <p>
          Roll out small portions of dough into thin circles. Place a spoonful
          of the prepared filling in the center. Carefully pinch the edges of
          the dough together, pleating as you go to form a tight, sealed
          dumpling. You can shape them into a traditional round or half-moon
          shape.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>How Long to Steam Momo</h3>
        <p>
          Once the momo are shaped, place them in a steamer basket lined with
          parchment paper to avoid sticking. Steam for about 15-20 minutes or
          until the dough turns translucent and the filling is cooked through.
          The momo will be soft and juicy once ready!
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>How to Serve Nepali Momo</h3>
        <p>
          Serve your freshly steamed momo with spicy momo chutney made from
          tomatoes, green chilies, garlic, and a little oil. Enjoy the soft,
          flavorful momo with a hot cup of Nepali tea or as a snack on its own!

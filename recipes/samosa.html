          The ingredients for making Aloo Samosa are simple but packed with
          flavor. Below is a list of the essential ingredients for both the

        <h3 style="margin-top: 40px">How to Make Aloo Samosa Step-By-Step</h3>
        <p>
          Making Aloo Samosas is a multi-step process, but the results are
          totally worth it. Here's a brief overview of the steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Make the dough for the samosa wrappers.</li>
          <li>Prepare the spiced potato filling.</li>
          <li>Shape the samosas and stuff them with the filling.</li>
          <li>Heat oil and fry the samosas until crispy and golden.</li>
          <li>Serve with chutney and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <hr />
        <h3>How to Make the Samosa Dough</h3>
        <p>
          To make the dough, combine wheat flour, a pinch of salt, and a little
          oil in a bowl. Gradually add water and knead the mixture into a smooth
          and firm dough. Cover it with a damp cloth and let it rest for about
          20 minutes before rolling it out.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>How to Prepare the Aloo Filling</h3>
        <p>
          For the filling, boil potatoes until soft. Once cooled, peel and mash
          them. In a pan, heat some oil and sauté onions, ginger, garlic, and
          green chilies until golden. Then, add your spices (cumin, coriander,
          garam masala, turmeric, and red chili powder) and cook briefly.
          Finally, mix in the mashed potatoes, add chopped coriander leaves, and
          adjust salt to taste. Let the mixture cool before using it as the
          filling.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>How to Shape the Samosas</h3>
        <p>
          Divide the dough into small balls and roll each one into a circle. Cut
          the circle in half, forming two semi-circles. Shape each semi-circle
          into a cone by folding it in half and sealing the edges. Stuff the
          cone with the potato filling, then pinch the open edges together to
          seal the samosa, ensuring it's tightly closed to avoid any filling
          leakage during frying.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>How Long to Fry the Samosas</h3>
        <p>
          Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot,
          gently slide the samosas into the oil, making sure not to overcrowd
          the pan. Fry them in batches for about 4-5 minutes, or until they turn
          golden brown and crispy. Be sure to turn them occasionally for even
          cooking.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>How to Serve Aloo Samosa</h3>
        <p>
          Serve your hot, crispy Aloo Samosas with tangy tamarind chutney, mint
          chutney, or a spicy tomato dip. Enjoy these delicious treats with a
          hot cup of chai or as a snack any time of the day!
